                    Hi, Nice to meet you! My name is Krysteen!
                </h2>
                <br> 
                <p>
                    I am a Vietnamese American, first generation student, who was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am on the Pre-Health track of going into PA school, but I have a strong passion for the arts and being creative through User Experience (UX) design! I enjoy working through design processes and integrating human centered design thinking in all the work that I do!  This is my portfolio of what I love doing outside of my medical studies which is coded and made with love by me to showcase my design thinking processes and the resulting final products!
